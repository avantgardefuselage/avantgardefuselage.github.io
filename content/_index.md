I’m Joshua. Not yet fully Swedish, but hoping to level up from my current British status shortly.   

I’m currently doing my best to automate myself out of a job. I love containers so much I'd happily live in one. DevOps, Automation, Infrastructure as Code, Continuous Integration, Container Orchestration and Microservices are things I specialise in.

I thrive in progressive and collaborative environments. I always make documentation a priority and ensure secure practices are applied.  I make all my skills and knowledge open source and I happily accept any pull requests.
