I’m Joshua. Not yet fully Swedish, but hoping to level up from my current British status shortly.   

I’m currently doing my best to automate myself out of a job. I love containers so much I'd happily live in one. DevOps, Automation, Infrastructure as Code, Continuous Integration, Container Orchestration and Microservices are things I specialise in.

I thrive in progressive and collaborative environments. I always make documentation a priority and ensure secure practices are applied.  I make all my skills and knowledge open source and I happily accept any pull requests. 

Things I like: Puppet, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, Terraform, DevOps, Gitlab, GoCD, Jenkins, Travis CI, Bash, Python, Linux, Git, Nginx, Consul, Nomad, Artifactory, Gerrit, Documentation, privacy, security, and being pedagogical.

Things I don't like: Windows, Oracle, undocumented processes.

Things I'm learning: C, how to farm sheep.
